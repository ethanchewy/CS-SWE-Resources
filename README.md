# Software Engineering + Computer Science Resources 

A lot of my friends and people I've worked with in the past have kids now that are interested in tech. A typical email I send is: 
```
Hi <x>,

Here are some resources for your <y> once <> enters high school that might be helpful:
* FIRST Robotics: https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc
....
* Summer Course at UC Berkeley CS (need to be 16-18 years old): https://precollege.berkeley.edu/commuter
```

Below is a list of vetted resources that I usually share when people ask me for resources.

### Research
A lot of these programs are school dependent. 

In general, you can contribute to open-source and read research papers in an area and write your own summaries / research. Then, you can reach out to interested professors and research labs.

Many of my friends, including myself conducted research in both high school and college by reaching out to professors and research labs that we were interested in. If you want an example email template, feel free to reach out.
