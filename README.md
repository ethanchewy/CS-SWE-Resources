# Software Engineering + Computer Science Resources 

A lot of my friends and people I've worked with in the past have kids now that are interested in tech. A typical email I send is: 
```

### Research
A lot of these programs are school dependent. In general, you can contribute to open-source and read research papers in an area and write your own summaries / research. Then, you can reach out to interested professors and research labs.

For UC Berkeley:
